# Given a search result (i.e. an ActiveRecord query object that responds to
# `offset`, `limit`, and `to_a`) and the current position in that result,
# determine the next and previous items.
#
# Since search results can shift or change during navigation, the current item
# may no longer be at the offset it was when the navigation started. This class
# tries to handle such cases gracefully. If the results have changed so much
# that the item no longer seems to be in it, the next and previous will be nil.
#
# If the offset of the current item is still in the result but has shifted,
# its new offset can be obtained by calling `offset_actual`.
#
